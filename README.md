# Pattern recognition Sharvit B2

## Overview
This project focuses on evaluating classical pattern recognition methods using a small but complex image dataset known as **SharvitB2**. The dataset includes binary representations of 18 different object classes (e.g., bird, key, turtle, fork) across 12 samples. The project evaluates various classical methods for pattern recognition in conjunction with classifiers like **KMeans** and **KNN**. The goal is to assess the behavior of these methods in the presence of variable deformations, orientations, and occlusions.


## How to install
```git clone https://github.com/Raygunito/Pattern-recognition-SharvitB2.git```

Then compile and use the CLI as main class.

Make sure you also have set all the JAR files inside the `lib` folder as libraries. And the `res` folder is in the same folder as the console.

## Dataset
The SharvitB2 dataset consists of:
- **18 classes** representing various objects, such as birds, keys, turtles, forks, and more.
- **12 samples per class**, each potentially subject to deformations and variable orientations.

## Data Files
Ensure that the data files are present in the `res/Signatures/` folder in the following subdirectories:
- **ART**
- **GFD**
- **Yang**
- **Zernike7**
